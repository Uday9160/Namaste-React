# 06 - Exploring the world

Until last chapter, we were using mock data to render the UI. In this chapter, we learnt about working with real time data from the Web (Our world basically). Then, we covered different types of System Architectures, different approaches to fetch API and render in UI. Today's important concept was one of the basic React Hooks useEffect. We tried using useEffect in all combinations and understanding it in depth. Importance of conditional rendering and Shimmer in UI were explained.

## Theory:

- What is `Microservice`?
- What is `Monolith architecture`?
- What is the `difference` between `Monolith and Microservice?
- Why do we need a `useEffect Hook`?
- What is `Optional Chaining`?
- What is `Shimmer UI`?
- What is the `difference` between `JS expression and JS statement`?
- What is `Conditional Rendering`? explain with a code example.
- What is `CORS`?
- What is `async and await`?
- What is the use of `const json = await data.json()`; in `getRestaurants()`?

## Coding:

- Play with the `useEffect Hook` to see when it is called? (before or after render)
- Play with the `dependency array` in useEffect Hook.
- Play with the `developer console` by putting a `debugger` in render and `useEffect`.
- Call an `actual API call`.
- `Handle Error` in your `API call`.
- Build `Shimmer UI` when `data is not loaded`.
- `Render your UI` with `actual API data`.
- Make `Search functionality` work.
- Make a `Login Logout` button that `toggles with a state`.
