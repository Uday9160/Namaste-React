    <summary>Difference between a Library and Framework?</summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
    - A <strong>library</strong> is like going to Ikea. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You donâ€™t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control. <br><br>
    - A <strong>framework</strong>, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input. <br><br>
    - <strong>Both Frameworks and Libraries</strong> are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems or to optimise performance. <br><br>
    - A key difference between the two is the <strong>inversion of control</strong>. When using a library, the control remains with the developer who tells the application when to call library functions. When using a framework, the control is reversed, which means that the framework tells the developer where code needs to be provided and calls it as it requires.

    <summary>What is CDN? Why do we use it?</summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
    - A CDN (content delivery network), also called a content distribution network, is a group of geographically distributed and interconnected servers. They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its delivery. <br><br>
    - The primary goal of a CDN is to improve web performance by reducing the time needed to send content and rich media to users. <br><br>
    - CDN architecture is also designed to reduce network latency caused by hauling traffic over long distances and across several networks. Eliminating latency is important as more dynamic content, video and software as a service are delivered to an increasing number of mobile devices.
