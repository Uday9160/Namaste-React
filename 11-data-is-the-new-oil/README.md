# 11 - Data is the new Oil

Today was about Data layer of the app. Consider data as if it's oil, use it wisely because that is what powers the engine, and its expensive as well. There were discussion on what is data in React, how to pass data in the component hierarchy, from parent to child, child to siblings, child to parent, and finally throughout the app.
