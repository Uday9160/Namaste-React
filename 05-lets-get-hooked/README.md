# 05 - Let's get hooked

Today was the continuation of previous chapter where we started to develop a food delivery app. In this chapter, we re-organised the repo structure, understood the importance of clean coding principles, different ways of exporting and importing modules(components). Then, the hero of this chapter Hooks got everyone hooked to their screen. It was indeed a 3 hours knowledge heavy session where foundation of hooks was laid. We used hooks to filter the restaurants based on search input.

### Topics Coverd:-

While Creating `food ordering app` covered:
- React File Structure
- Different ways to Export:`Named Export`, `Default Export` and `* as export`
- File extension: like `app.js`& `app.jsx`
- config file (or constant file)
- `Building Search Functionality`
- `One way data Binding` in react
- what are `hooks`?
- `useState` hook in react & why we use it
- creating `local variable` vs `local state variable`
- Why do we need `state variable` ?
- Creating `filter function` for search functionality.
- Passing `Restaurant Card` data using state variable.

## Coding:

- `Clean up` your code.
- Create a `Folder Structure` for your app.
- Make `different files` for each Component.
- Create a `config file`.
- Use all types of `import and export`.
- Create a `Search Box` in your App.
- Use `useState` to create a variable and `bind` it to the input box.
- Try to make your `search bar work`.
