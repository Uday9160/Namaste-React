# 05 - Let's get hooked

Today was the continuation of previous chapter where we started to develop a food delivery app. In this chapter, we re-organised the repo structure, understood the importance of clean coding principles, different ways of exporting and importing modules(components). Then, the hero of this chapter Hooks got everyone hooked to their screen. It was indeed a 3 hours knowledge heavy session where foundation of hooks was laid. We used hooks to filter the restaurants based on search input.
